To calculate the total number of refugees in a region, we sum up the data from all origin countries. The same applies to calculating all refugees from one country of origin.\n- To calculate the number of refugees per 1,000 people in a country, we divide the number of refugees by the total population of the country and multiply by 1,000. The population estimates come from a long-run dataset [maintained by Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).",
